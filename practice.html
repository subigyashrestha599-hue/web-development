        static-default
            elements stays in flow
            cannot be moved with top/left
            just normal layout
        
        relative-element is still in flow but you can shift it
            -it moves relative to its original position
            the space it occupied stays there

        absolute-element is removed from noraml flow
            -it looks for its nearest positioned ancestor(no static ancestor)
            -the ancestor becomes the reference/(0,0)
            -if none found,the viewport becomes the refernce
            -absolute positioning means-place me inside my nearest positioned ancestor

        fixed- like absolute but,the coordinate system is always the viewport
            -it does not care about parents
            -it doesnot move when scrolling
            -it is permanently pinned to the screen

        sticky-it has a dynamic coordinate system
            -it acts like relative in normal flow,but when scrolling reaches a threshold and switches to fixed
            -it is limited by its parent box,means it cannot excape its container
            -used to stick header when scrolling

            we have top, left that accepts value in px
            top:0px
            left:200px
            left:-200px

            z-index-when two or more items are stacked on each other,we can use z-index to determine who comes first and who goes to last
